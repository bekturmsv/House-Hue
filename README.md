<span style="font-size: 1.7rem"> Back-end üóÑÔ∏è </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem"> In the server folder, the index.js file starts the local server on port 3000 and connects to the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/"> MongoDB </a> database. Create an <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/">Express</a> application that will connect routers in the main application. On the server side I also used such tools as: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt"> bcrypt </a> (for encrypting passwords), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser"> cookie-parser </a> (for working with cookies), <a href = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv"> dotenv </a> (for creating local variables). Something else to note is that server-side scripts are run to bring up the entire website. </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.7rem"> Front-end üñ•Ô∏è </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem"> On the client side, I used <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html"> React + Vite </a>. After running the "build" script, a new <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy"> dist </a> folder is created, in which an index.html file is also created, it is this file that is rendered on the site after the build. On the client side I used such tools as: <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/"> Redux/Toolkit</a>(for state management), <a href="https://firebase.google.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA04arBhAkEiwAuNOsIgATTPnHWl0X2_otnHS1JrUe5elv8G7v-ChNf5_bWV06a8twaqWt1RoCFNcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"> Firebase</a>(for uploading and storing images on the cloud), <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main"> react-router-dom</a>(for routing), <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" > TailwindCSS</a>(for styling), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist">redux-persist</a>(for saving data to LocalStorage).</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.7rem"> How to start locally </span>

Therefore, to connect such modules as MongoDB, Firebase and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31309759/what-is-secret-key-for-jwt-based-authentication-and-how-to-generate-it"> secret key for jwt </a> token you need to create .env file, create variables as in .env.example files, which you can see in the project, and assign your values to them. </span>
